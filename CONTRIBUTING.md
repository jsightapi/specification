## Feedback

Our project is still in its early stages, so feedback is the most crucial contribution to its
development.

**Your feedback is extremely valuable to us!**

- Is the JSight API language user-friendly?
- Is the JSight Schema language user-friendly?
- What's not clear?
- Anything bothering you?
- What can be done better?
- What is missing?

Please get in touch with us and let us know what you think:

- Email: [support@jsight.io](mailto:support@jsight.io).
- Telegram: [@jsight_support](https://t.me/jsight_support).
- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/jsightapi/specification/issues/new).

## Opening Issues

Please [raise a new issue](https://github.com/jsightapi/specification/issues/new) if you discover a
bug.

If you find a way that can help improve the JSight API or JSight Schema languages, that would also
be a very good reason for an issue.

If you simply don't comprehend something, you can create an issue for this also. So, write: *“How do
I do X?”*. Issues like this are important to us because they help us figure out where the bottleneck
is when learning JSight.

## Commenting

Your comments on issues and pull requests are also a great help. Please share your thoughts and
suggestions, they are important to us.

Kindly re-read your remarks to ensure that they are as courteous as possible.

## English Language

We are not native English speakers, but we work hard to ensure that the English in our project is
perfect. If you are a native speaker and notice an inaccuracy in the specification, please contact
us or file a bug.

## Direct Contributions

The branch `dev` is used to develop specifications. Make all pull requests in it.

Please do not submit a pull request without specifying an appropriate issue. If the required issue
does not exist, create one. It will be much easier for us to accept your revision.

If you plan to add a new feature to the language, please create a new issue first and wait for our
approval. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that your revision will be accepted.

If you wish to contribute in the development of the language, but don’t know from where to start,
write to us, and we will share an interesting task with you:

- Email: [support@jsight.io](mailto:support@jsight.io).
- Telegram: [@jsight_support](https://t.me/jsight_support).

### Making pull requests

- Write a precise description of what you did **in the body of the pull request**.
- Don't forget to include links to the issues it resolves in the pull request.
- If possible, squash small interim commits that will prevent us from understanding your
  corrections. Leave only useful commits that will help to understand your logic. If the revision is
  small, then squash all the commits into a single one.

### Specification Style Guide

Please follow the writing and formatting style that is already used in the specifications.
